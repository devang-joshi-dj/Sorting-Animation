# Sorting-Animation

### **Description**
In this project I will be making animations for sorting algorithms.
Rather than animation tools we will work with JavaScript and it's library's.

I am doing sorting of different sizes of smiley (!Numbers).
The workflow should be easy to understand by anyone and in next part we want users to interact with smiley and sort them.

### **Technologies In Use**
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* HTML CSS
